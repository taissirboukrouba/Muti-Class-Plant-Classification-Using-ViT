      ArticleDescription:
          "You must not only devote attention to your plants, but also invest money on them. If you want your plants to be lush and healthy, invest in high-quality potting soil, fertilizer, pots, and equipment.\nAdding Light:\nWhen you get up in the morning, open the blinds and curtains first so your indoor plant can get some light. Also, while you're gone from home for work, position your plants so that they get enough light throughout the day. When it comes to maintaining plants near the window, light-loving plants should take precedence.\n\nWatering:\nYou may sprinkle the foliage of humidity-loving plants like the peace lily, rubber tree, or fiddle leaf fig in the morning. Simply ensure that the temperature is warm enough for misting and that they are exposed to sufficient light and air movement.\n\nCommunicate:\nSpend a few minutes with your plants whenever you have the opportunity, whether it's in the morning, afternoon, or evening. Make a connection with them and caress their leaves. You'll also be able to detect plant issues such as pests and diseases sooner."),

      ArticleDescription:
          "Dedicate a day to these duties once a week on the weekend or whenever you have free time.\n\nWatering: \nKeep a close eye on your plants to see which ones require more frequent watering and which ones simply require water every other week. The best approach to check for moisture is to poke your finger into the dirt. It's time to water your plants if you notice it's getting dry.\nA weekly hydration check should be done on Saturday or Sunday. The majority of houseplants thrive on a weekly watering routine. However, it's crucial to keep in mind that 'how often should you water' is also influenced by the environment and weather and the plant itself.\n\nPruning :) \nKeep a pair of gardening sheers with you while watering to clip off dead, dying, and diseased plant parts once a week. Also, if you find fading blooms or leaves, remove them. Only a few plants, in general, need to be pruned on a regular basis.\n\nRotation?!\nKeep this task in your weekly work routine because indoor plants often bend toward the sun. Once a week, rotate your plants! By orienting your houseplants toward the light, you can guarantee that all areas of the plant receive an adequate quantity of light.\n\nShake it UP! \nIf you have a fiddle leaf plant, lightly shiver it to simulate a gust of wind, which will help it grow a robust root system"),
